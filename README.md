We have created a website named "NatureNetwork", that has a feed of potential volunteer opportunities with 
a description, tags, location, and more that the users can see. Each user has their own profile with basic
information, as well as badges and their leader board rankings. Badges are given according to achievements 
that the user has gotten, such as their first volunteering task, or maybe their 100th. 

We used the MERN stack with Material UI to deploy the website, and implemented a dynamic feed with Pagination.
In the future, users would be able to apply to these opportunities and add their own events/posts. Upon 
completion, users would also be awarded points and badges, to complete the gamification element. 

Both the source code for the website and the pitch will be within the repo.
