We have created a website named "NatureNetwork", that has a feed of potential volunteer opportunities with 
a description, tags, location, and more that the users can see. Each user has a profile with basic
information, as well as badges and leaderboard rankings. Badges are given according to achievements 
that the user has gotten, with different tiers for varying achievements. Users can pick and choose whatever activities they would like to do, and those who would like to post events can do so to gain volunteers. 

We used the MERN stack with Material UI to deploy the website and implemented a dynamic feed with Pagination.
In the future, users will be able to apply to these opportunities and add their events/posts. Upon 
completion, users would also be awarded points and badges, to complete the gamification element. 

Both the source code for the website and the pitch will be within the repo.
